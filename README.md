# ShepherdPi
Raspberry Pi for the classroom
## Terminology
* IDE: Integrated Development Environment such as BlueJ or Eclipse.
* Embedded programming: Writing software that runs inside a device.
* IoT: the internet of things, the goal of networking all household items.
* LED: light-emitting diode, a tiny and low-energy light bulb.
* LCD: liquid crystal display, a low-energy digital screen, usually black on grey.
## Useful information
* The BlueJ IDE can be installed on Raspberry Pi:
[instructions](https://www.bluej.org/raspberrypi/).
* Create a unix command to report CPU temperature:
```alias temp='/opt/vc/bin/vcgencmd measure_temp'```
* The [Osoyoo](http://osoyoo.com/2017/07/13/raspberry-pi-3-starter-learning-kit-introduction/) 
sensor kit guide has links to videos describing various projects.
* The [Kookye](http://kookye.com/category/tutorials/rapsberry-pi-projects/)
sensor kit guide has links to many Raspberry Pi project descriptions.
* Introduction to Raspberry Pi IoT applications
on [DZone](https://dzone.com/refcardz/iot-applications-with-java-and-raspberry-pi?chapter=1)
includes Java code to control an LED connected to the GPIO. (Free HTML. Must register for PDF.)
* [Java Tutorial Network](https://javatutorial.net/category/raspberry-pi-java) 
has a [tutorial](https://javatutorial.net/raspberry-pi-java-tutorial) 
that includes Java code to control an LED connected to the GPIO. 
* The [Pi4J](http://pi4j.com/) project
has a Java API that you can download and use in your programs.
